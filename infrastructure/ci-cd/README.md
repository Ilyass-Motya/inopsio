## Best Practices

### Pipeline Design
- **Fast Feedback**: Quick feedback on code changes
- **Reliable Builds**: Consistent and reproducible builds
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive quality gates
- **Security First**: Security scanning and validation

### Approval Process
- **Clear Criteria**: Well-defined approval criteria
- **Timely Reviews**: Fast approval turnaround
- **Escalation Path**: Clear escalation procedures
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive approval documentation

## Getting Started

1. **Setup CI/CD**: Configure CI/CD pipelines
2. **Define Gates**: Set up approval gates
3. **Test Pipelines**: Test all pipeline stages
4. **Monitor Performance**: Monitor pipeline metrics
5. **Optimize**: Continuously optimize pipelines
