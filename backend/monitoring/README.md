# Backend Monitoring

This directory contains shared monitoring configurations, Prometheus exporters, and alerting rules used across all backend services.

## Components

### Prometheus Exporters
- **Node Exporter**: System metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- **cAdvisor**: Container metrics and resource usage
- **Custom Exporters**: Service-specific business metrics

### Alerting Rules
- **Service Health**: Service availability and health checks
- **Performance**: Response time and throughput monitoring
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and disk utilization
- **Security**: Authentication failures and suspicious activity
- **Business Metrics**: SLA violations and business KPIs

### Grafana Dashboards
- **Service Overview**: High-level service health and performance
- **Infrastructure**: System and container resource usage
- **Business Metrics**: Application-specific KPIs and dashboards
- **Security**: Security events and compliance monitoring

## Configuration Files

### `prometheus.yml`
Central Prometheus configuration for all backend services with:
- Service discovery for Kubernetes deployments
- Scrape configurations for all services
- Alerting rule file references
- Recording rules for performance optimization

### Alerting Rules
- `service-health.yml`: Service availability and health monitoring
- `performance.yml`: Performance and throughput alerts
- `security.yml`: Security event and compliance alerts
- `business.yml`: Business metric and SLA alerts

## Service Integration

Each backend service includes:
- **Metrics Endpoint**: `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping
- **Health Checks**: `/health` and `/ready` endpoints for Kubernetes
- **Custom Metrics**: Business-specific metrics and counters
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs

## Monitoring Stack

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboard management
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and notification management
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing across services
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging and log analysis

## Alerting Channels

- **Slack**: Development and staging alerts
- **PagerDuty**: Production critical alerts
- **Email**: Compliance and security alerts
- **Webhook**: Custom integrations and automation

## Best Practices

### Metric Naming
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include service and tenant information
- Follow Prometheus metric naming standards

### Alert Design
- Set appropriate thresholds and time windows
- Include runbook links in alert descriptions
- Use severity levels (critical, warning, info)
- Implement alert fatigue prevention

### Dashboard Design
- Create service-specific dashboards
- Include both technical and business metrics
- Use consistent color schemes and layouts
- Provide drill-down capabilities

## Getting Started

1. **Local Development**: Use `make monitoring` to start monitoring stack
2. **Service Metrics**: Add metrics to your service using the provided libraries
3. **Custom Dashboards**: Create service-specific Grafana dashboards
4. **Alert Testing**: Use `make test-alerts` to validate alerting rules

For service-specific monitoring setup, see individual service documentation.
