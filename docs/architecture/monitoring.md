**Inopsio Monitoring, Observability & Alerting Architecture**

### Purpose  
To define the full observability strategy for Inopsio’s multi-tenant SaaS platform — covering metrics collection, tracing, logging, alerting, and visualization.  
This system enables operational resilience, SLA enforcement, and proactive troubleshooting across both cloud-native and AI/security workloads.

***

### 1. Overview  

- **Core Philosophy:** “Observe, Predict, and React” — Monitoring is integrated into every phase of software delivery.  
- **Scope:** Backend, AI services, frontends, infrastructure, and security events.  
- **Tools Stack:**  
  - **Prometheus** – Metrics & time-series collection  
  - **Grafana** – Dashboard visualization  
  - **Loki** – Centralized log aggregation  
  - **Jaeger** – Distributed tracing  
  - **Alertmanager** – Alert routing and escalation  
  - **Elastic Agent (Optional)** – Forwarding to SIEM  
  - **Sentry** – Exception tracking (frontend/backend)

### 2. Architecture Layers  

| Layer | Components | Purpose | Data Source |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **Metrics** | Prometheus, Node Exporter | Service health, performance, CPU, memory | K8s pods & apps |
| **Logs** | Loki, FluentBit | Centralized structured logs | App stdout, audit logs |
| **Traces** | Jaeger, OpenTelemetry Collector | Distributed request tracing | Microservice transactions |
| **Dashboards** | Grafana | Visualization of health and usage | Metrics & logs combined |
| **Alerts** | Prometheus Alertmanager | Policy-based triggers | Metric thresholds |
| **Errors** | Sentry | Error aggregation for DX visibility | Frontend + API exceptions |

### 3. Data Flow Diagram (Simplified)

**(1)** Application logs and metrics → **FluentBit/Node Exporter**  
**(2)** Sent to Prometheus + Loki  
**(3)** Traces collected and exported using OpenTelemetry SDKs  
**(4)** Dashboards and alerts consumed via Grafana and Alertmanager  
**(5)** Optionally, Alert events streamed to InoSec SIEM for analysis

### 4. Metrics and Dashboards  

| Scope | Metric Example | Purpose | Grafana Dashboard |
|--------|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Infrastructure** | `node_cpu_seconds_total` / `kube_pod_status_phase` | Cluster stability | Infra Health |
| **Backend** | `http_request_duration_seconds` | API latency | API Performance |
| **AI/ML** | `model_inference_time_ms` / `queue_depth` | Pipeline health | InoSec AI |
| **Frontend** | `core_web_vitals_score` | UX performance | Frontend Metrics |
| **Security** | `failed_login_count` / `policy_violation_count` | SOC alerts | InoSec Security |
| **Tenancy** | `tenant_active_sessions` | SLA compliance | Tenant Usage |

### 5. Logging Strategy  

**Log Format (Structured JSON):**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-24T13:45:00Z",
  "level": "info",
  "service": "crm-service",
  "tenant_id": "uuid",
  "request_id": "trace-id",
  "message": "Lead created",
  "metadata": { "lead_id": "uuid", "duration_ms": 152 }
}
```

**Features:**
- Structured logs with correlation identifiers (trace + tenant).  
- Sensitive data masked per security compliance.  
- Log rotation handled via Loki retention policy.

***

### 6. Distributed Tracing  

- **Jaeger** integrated via OpenTelemetry in all microservices.  
- Tracing spans:
  - API gateway request entry →  
  - Business microservice →  
  - Kafka event →  
  - Celery/BullMQ async job →  
  - Database or storage I/O  
- Each trace visualized by service topology and latency waterfall.

### 7. Alerting and Incident Management  

| Alert Type | Condition | Action | Escalation Path |
|-------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **API Latency** | p95 > 2s | Automatic Slack alert | DevOps on-call |
| **DB Error Rate** | > 0.5% failures | PagerDuty notification | DBA + Platform |
| **CPU Saturation** | > 85% sustained | Auto-scale trigger | K8s HPA |
| **Security Violation** | Policy trigger | InoSec SIEM ingestion | Security Team |

**Integrations:** PagerDuty, Slack, Jira, Keycloak audit APIs

### 8. Tenancy-Level Metrics  

Multi-tenant observability is critical.  
Prometheus labels and Grafana dashboards track per-tenant health:

```yaml
labels:
  tenant: tenant_id
  service: crm-service
  region: eu-west-1
  instance: pod-4
```

This enables cost-per-tenant analysis, usage forecasting, and anomaly detection via Grafana Query Builder.

***

### 9. Security and Compliance Integration  

- Enforced TLS metrics export endpoints (`/_metrics` with auth).  
- Logs sanitized using **Vault key policies**.  
- All alert channels audited via `/security/audit-trails/`.  
- SOC2 alignment: control sections CC7.1 (Monitoring), CC7.2 (Incident Detection).

### 10. Maintenance Guidelines  

| Task | Schedule | Responsible |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Metrics retention cleanup | Weekly | DevOps |  
| Loki index optimization | Bi-weekly | Infra Engineer |  
| Alert tuning audit | Monthly | SRE Lead |  
| Dashboard review | Each release | Platform PM |
