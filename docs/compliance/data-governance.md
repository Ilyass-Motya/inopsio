**Inopsio Data Governance, Privacy, and Residency Framework**

### Purpose  
To define how Inopsio collects, stores, processes, protects, and anonymizes data across its SaaS ecosystem.  
It connects to compliance, architecture, and security layers, forming the foundation of global audit readiness.

***

### 1. Overview  

- **Objective:** Establish transparent, compliant, and secure data handling practices.  
- **Coverage:**  
  - Multi-tenant data lifecycle  
  - Data residency & sovereignty (Morocco + MENA compliance)  
  - Privacy protection (GDPR & local equivalents)  
  - AI model management (ethical data policies).  
- **Principles:**  
  1. Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency  
  2. Purpose Limitation  
  3. Data Minimization  
  4. Accuracy  
  5. Storage Limitation  
  6. Integrity and Confidentiality

### 2. Data Lifecycle Management  

| Phase | Policy | Description | Responsible Entity |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Collection** | Consent-first policy | Explicit user consent or lawful basis | Data Controller |
| **Storage** | Encrypted at rest and in transit | Vault + PostgreSQL AES-256 | Infra Team |
| **Usage** | Minimal use of PII for AI features | Controlled APIs | Product Team |
| **Sharing** | Only through authorized integration APIs | Strict policy logging | DPO |
| **Retention** | Time-limited per tenant SLA | Automated purge jobs | Compliance Officer |
| **Deletion** | “Right to be Forgotten” requests automated | GDPR-compliant endpoint | Legal/Infra |

Retention schedules stored in `/infrastructure/policies/data-retention.yml`.

### 3. Regional Data Sovereignty  

| Region | Policy | Physical Location | Provider | Notes |
|--------|----------|------------------|-----------|--------|
| **Morocco (Primary)** | CNDP-certified hosting required | Casablanca (Maroc Data Center) | Inopsio Cloud | Default region |
| **MENA (Expansion)** | Local residency mandates per country | Riyadh / UAE | AWS / Azure GovCloud | For large enterprises |
| **EU Clients** | GDPR-compliant | Frankfurt | OVH / AWS | Hybrid connectivity |
| **Failover** | Encrypted backup zone | Paris | OVH Backup | Always at-rest encrypted |

### 4. Data Classification Model  

| Tier | Type | Example | Level |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| **Public** | Non-sensitive data | Blog, documentation | Open |
| **Internal** | Configs, internal usage metrics | Non-personal | Restricted |
| **Confidential** | User profile data, CRM info | Tenant-level | Confidential |
| **Sensitive** | Credentials, PII, threat logs | Vault-managed | Highly restricted |
| **AI-sensitive** | Datasets for model training | Anonymized only | Controlled |

Classification matrix stored in `/docs/compliance/data-classification-matrix.md`.

***

### 5. Data Access and Auditing  

- **Access Control:** RBAC through Keycloak; audited via Vault.  
- **Audit Logging:**  
  - Every data access event logged.  
  - Immutable logs stored in Loki and appended in Vault.  
  - Quarterly review audit snapshots archived in `/docs/compliance/audit-artifacts/`.  
- **Data Export Control:**  
  - All data exports are token-validated, authorized by DPO.  
  - AI data extraction pipelines log context IDs for traceability.

***

### 6. Anonymization & Pseudonymization  

- PII masking leveraged through anonymizer middleware:  
  - **Approach:** Replace user identifiers with tenant-hashed UUIDs.  
  - **Scope:** CRM, ERP, Workflow datasets.  
- AI models trained only on anonymized datasets (verified at preprocessing).  
- **Encryption keys:** Tenant-specific; managed by Vault, rotated regularly.  

Scripts located in `/backend/libs/security/anonymizer.ts`.

### 7. Data Subject Rights (GDPR & Law 09-08 Morocco)  

| Right | Method | Execution Timeline |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Access | API endpoint `/api/v1/user/data/access` | 30 days |
| Erasure | “Right to be Forgotten” workflow | 30 days |
| Rectification | Profile update validation route | 14 days |
| Portability | Export in JSON or CSV | 15 days |
| Objection | Email-based form | 7 days |

All activities logged for audit under `/logs/audit/compliance.log`.

***

### 8. AI and Ethical Data Policy  

- AI services (FastAPI) cannot use identifiable data without consent.  
- Model datasets processed via separate hashing pipeline.  
- `ml-service` and `inosec-service` validated for non-PII input.  
- Integrated fairness checkers to ensure bias mitigation per ISO/IEC 24028.

### Expert Recommendation  

The **Data Governance & Privacy Policy** document formalizes Inopsio’s ethical and legal commitment to data security across Morocco, MENA, and EU-regulated clients.  
It’s a keystone for certification audits (ISO 27001, SOC 2, CNDP compliance).
