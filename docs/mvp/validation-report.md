**Inopsio MVP Validation Report – Release Phase 1 (Core Modules)**

### Purpose  
To formally record the results of the MVP validation cycle — confirming that each feature, service, and user flow achieves the objectives defined in the PRD v2.0 and Validation Scenarios documents.  
This file also establishes readiness criteria for market rollout, compliance review, and stakeholder presentation.

### Expert Recommendation  

The **MVP Validation Report** acts as your end-of-phase dossier — essential for investors, compliance officers, and development continuity. Once finalized, it should be digitally signed by PMO, QA, and Security leads, and version-tagged alongside your `v1.2-release` branch in GitHub.
