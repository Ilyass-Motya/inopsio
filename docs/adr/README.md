# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document important architectural decisions made during the development of the Inopsio platform.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help maintain a historical record of why certain decisions were made and provide guidance for future development.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded
3. **Context**: The situation and problem that led to this decision
4. **Decision**: The architectural decision that was made
5. **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes of this decision
6. **Alternatives**: Other options that were considered
7. **Related ADRs**: Links to related decisions

## ADR Lifecycle

### **1. Proposed**
- ADR is created and documented
- Team review and discussion
- Stakeholder input and feedback

### **2. Accepted**
- Decision is approved and implemented
- ADR becomes part of the architectural baseline
- Implementation begins

### **3. Deprecated**
- Decision is no longer recommended
- New approach is preferred
- Migration path is provided

### **4. Superseded**
- ADR is replaced by a newer decision
- Link to the superseding ADR is provided
- Historical context is preserved

## Creating New ADRs

### **When to Create an ADR**
- Making significant architectural decisions
- Choosing between multiple viable options
- Establishing patterns and standards
- Resolving architectural conflicts
- Documenting design rationale

### **How to Create an ADR**
1. **Identify the Decision**: Clearly identify the architectural decision
2. **Gather Context**: Document the situation and constraints
3. **Consider Alternatives**: Evaluate different options
4. **Make the Decision**: Choose the best option
5. **Document Consequences**: List positive and negative outcomes
6. **Get Approval**: Review with team and stakeholders
7. **Implement**: Follow through with the decision

### **ADR Template**
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[The situation and problem that led to this decision]

## Decision
[The architectural decision that was made]

## Consequences
[The positive and negative outcomes of this decision]

## Alternatives
[Other options that were considered]

## Related ADRs
[Links to related decisions]
```

## ADR Review Process

### **Initial Review**
- Technical team review
- Architecture team validation
- Stakeholder input

### **Approval Process**
- Team consensus
- Architecture team approval
- Executive approval for major decisions

### **Implementation**
- Decision implementation
- Monitoring and validation
- Documentation updates

### **Periodic Review**
- Quarterly ADR review
- Decision validation
- Update or deprecation as needed

## ADR Maintenance

### **Regular Updates**
- Quarterly review of all ADRs
- Status updates as needed
- Link maintenance and validation

### **Deprecation Process**
- Identify outdated decisions
- Create superseding ADRs
- Update references and links
- Archive deprecated ADRs

### **Documentation**
- Keep ADRs up to date
- Maintain clear status indicators
- Provide migration guidance
- Link related decisions

## Benefits of ADRs

### **Historical Record**
- Document why decisions were made
- Preserve context and rationale
- Learn from past decisions

### **Team Alignment**
- Ensure everyone understands decisions
- Provide clear guidance
- Reduce confusion and conflicts

### **Future Reference**
- Guide future development
- Avoid repeating mistakes
- Maintain architectural consistency

### **Stakeholder Communication**
- Explain architectural choices
- Justify design decisions
- Build confidence in the architecture
