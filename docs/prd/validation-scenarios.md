**Inopsio Feature Validation Scenarios & Acceptance Criteria**

### Purpose  
To define clear validation processes, acceptance criteria, and end-to-end testing scenarios for all core modules and features listed in the PRD and Feature Map.  
This file ensures measurable alignment between feature delivery, UX quality, and business outcomes.

***

### 1. Overview  

- The validation framework ensures that every Inopsio release meets **MVP, UX, and security assurances**.  
- Each scenario follows a **Given / When / Then** model, with cross-links to features, requirements, and metrics.  
- This file links to `/docs/mvp/validation-report.md` for post-execution validation results.

**Linked Files:**  
- `/docs/prd/feature-map.md`  
- `/docs/prd/release-metrics.md`  
- `/docs/prd/ui-ux-guidelines.md`  
- `/docs/mvp/user-stories.md`

### 2. Scenario Structure

Each validation scenario should follow this structure:

```
Feature ID: CRM-001
Feature Name: Lead Management
Module: CRM
Owner: Frontend Team A
Version: 1.2
Linked KPI: 80% conversion rate improvement

Scenario ID: CRM-VAL-01
Objective: Validate successful lead creation flow.
Given: The user is logged in as a Sales Manager.
When: The user creates a new lead and sets mandatory fields.
Then: The lead should appear in the pipeline view within <2s, synced across tenants.
Validation Criteria:
- Form validation success
- Kafka event is logged
- Pipeline UI reflects update

```

### 3. Core Module Validation Scenarios  

#### CRM  
- **Lead Creation & Enrichment** – Validate data accuracy and event-driven sync.  
- **Pipeline Kanban** – Ensure drag/drop persists across browser sessions.  
- **Analytics Dashboard** – Confirm correct visual data aggregation from DB.  

#### ERP  
- **Invoice Generation (React-PDF)** – Validate template load, data format, and PDF download accuracy.  
- **Procurement Flow** – Validate order statuses update properly via message bus.  

#### Workflow  
- **Process Designer (React Flow)** – Ensure node addition/removal updates live workflow data.  
- **Real-time Sync (WebSockets)** – Validate broadcast latency and backend consistency.  

#### InoSec  
- **Threat Detection** – Validate system alert flow from model inference to UI notification.  
- **Incident Dashboard** – Ensure threat logs populate correctly with severity filters.  

#### Platform  
- **Tenant Creation** – Validate per-tenant isolation and resource provisioning.  
- **Authentication & ACL** – Validate Keycloak integration for SSO & role mapping.

### 4. Performance Validation Scenarios  

| Scenario | Validation Target | Tool | Linked Doc |
|-----------|------------------|------|-------------|
| Load Test | 500 tenant load test latency | k6 | `/docs/performance/benchmarking.md` |
| Stress Test | DB failover resiliency | Grafana Cloud Alerts | `/docs/architecture/monitoring.md` |
| Security Scan | OWASP Top 10 test | ZAP, Trivy | `/security/audit/scan-guidelines.md` |

***

### 5. UX Validation Scenarios  

| Feature | Expected Outcome | Testing Tool |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| Form Navigation | All fields validatable via Tab key | Playwright Accessibility Test |
| Chart Legend | Fully accessible with keyboard | Axe-core plugin |
| Multi-language (RTL) | Layouts correctly rendered in Arabic/French | Cypress script |
| Toast Notifications | Accessible via screen readers | Jest + React Testing Library |

**Reference:** `/docs/prd/ui-ux-guidelines.md#accessibility`

***

### 6. Acceptance Criteria Framework  

| Validation Area | Definition of Done (DoD) |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Functional | Feature meets UX & technical specs with zero critical bugs |
| Performance | Response times below 2s for all API calls |
| Security | No CVEs pending; checkov/OPA scans pass |
| Usability | Meets WCAG 2.1 AA compliance |
| Observability | Metrics and traces visible in Grafana and Jaeger |

***

### 7. Validation Reporting Pipeline  
- Automation integrated into CI/CD pipeline:  
  - Unit → Integration → E2E → Smoke → Load → Compliance tests.  
- Reports stored in `/docs/mvp/validation-report.md`.  
- Automated triggers via `backend-tests.yml` and `frontend-ci.yml`.
