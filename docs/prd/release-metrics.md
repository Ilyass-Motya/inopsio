**Inopsio Product Release Metrics & Success Analytics**

### Purpose  
To define measurable success metrics for every version of the Inopsio platform.  
This file serves as the performance evaluation framework for releases, ensuring every module delivers quantifiable business, technical, and user value.

***

### 1. Overview  
- Inopsio follows an **OKR-driven release strategy**, connecting release goals (Objectives) to measurable indicators (Key Results).  
- Release metrics are grouped by dimension: Product, Technical, Customer, and Operational.  
- This document is continuously updated post-MVP launch to reflect real-world product performance.

### 6. Release Evaluation Framework  

Each release version includes a **Release Evaluation Checklist**:
1. Validate all release metrics via dashboards.  
2. Tag successful milestones in `/docs/release-notes/version-x.y.md`.  
3. Publish cross-team retrospective results.  
4. Archive performance graphs in `/docs/analytics/release-snapshots/`.

***

### 7. Integration with Dashboards  

- Metrics visualized through **Grafana dashboards**, grouped by domain and product module.  
- API endpoints for metrics ingestion: `/api/v1/analytics/metrics/`  
- Raw data sources:  
  - Product analytics database (PostgreSQL replica)  
  - Prometheus for technical KPIs  
  - Sentry and Loki for errors and operations
