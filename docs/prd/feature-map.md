**Inopsio Feature Map — PRD v2.0 Companion**

### Purpose  
To detail every major functional feature within the Inopsio ecosystem, mapped by module (CRM, ERP, Email, Workflow, Security, Dashboard). This map ensures traceability between business goals, implementation tickets, and success metrics.

***

### File Layout Example

#### 1. Overview
Provides the cross-feature synergy description.  
- Each feature aligns with a business objective defined in `/docs/prd/v2.0.md#objectives`.
- Each module links to MVP and architecture specs.

#### 2. Module Overview Table

#### 3. Feature Status Tracker  
| Feature | Status | Version | Priority | Linked Epic |
|----------|---------|----------|------------|--------------|
| CRM Pipeline | In Progress | 1.1 | High | CRM-EPIC-002 |
| ERP Invoicing | Delivered | 1.0 | High | ERP-EPIC-004 |
| Workflow Builder | Planned | 1.2 | Medium | WF-EPIC-001 |
| Threat Detection | Testing | 1.1 | High | SEC-EPIC-003 |

#### 4. Function–Architecture Traceability
Each feature maps directly to an architecture layer:
- **Frontend Integration** → `/docs/architecture/frontend-modules.md`
- **Backend Services** → `/docs/architecture/backend-services.md`
- **Database Models** → `/docs/architecture/data-model.md`
- **Message Flow (Kafka)** → `/docs/architecture/event-schemas.md`

#### 5. KPIs & Measurement Rules  
Outlines how each feature’s success is quantified, with cross-references to `/docs/governance/business-kpis.md` and `/docs/mvp/validation-report.md`.

#### 6. Future Features (Roadmap Integration)
Connects to Roadmap file for release planning:
- `/docs/roadmap/phase2-enterprise.md`
- `/docs/roadmap/phase3-automation.md`
